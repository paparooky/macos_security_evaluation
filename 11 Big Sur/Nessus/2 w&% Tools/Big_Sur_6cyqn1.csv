"PASSED","""2.4.10 Ensure Content Caching Is Disabled"" : [PASSED]

Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints and greater bandwidth on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.

Content types supported by Content Caching in macOS

Rationale:

The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk, they add to the management complexity. Since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary.

Impact:

This setting will adversely affect bandwidth usage between local subnets and the Internet.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable Content Caching:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sharing

Uncheck Content Caching

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable Content Caching:

$ sudo /usr/bin/AssetCacheManagerUtil deactivate

The output will include Content caching deactivated

"PASSED","""2.4.12 Ensure Media Sharing Is Disabled"" : [PASSED]

Starting with macOS 10.15 Apple has provided a control to allow a user to share Apple downloaded content on all Apple devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID. This allows a user to share downloaded Movies, Music or TV shows with other controlled macOS, iOS and iPadOS devices as well as photos with Apple TVs.

With this capability guest users can also use media downloaded on the computer.

The recommended best practice is not to use the computer as a server but to utilize Apple's cloud storage to download and use content stored there if content stored with Apple is used on multiple devices.

https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-media-sharing-on-mac-mchlp13371337/mac This capability requires the use of macOS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.

Content types supported by content caching in macOS

Rationale:

Disabling Media Sharing reduces the remote attack surface of the system.

Impact:

Media Sharing allows for pre-downloaded content on a Mac to be available to other Apple devices on the same network. Leaving this disabled forces device users to stream or download content from each Apple authorized device. This sharing could even allow unauthorized devices on the same network media access.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable Media Sharing:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sharing

Uncheck Media Sharing

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable Media Sharing:

$ sudo -u <username> defaults write com.apple.amp.mediasharingd home-sharing-enabled -int 0

example:

$ sudo -u test2 defaults write com.apple.amp.mediasharingd home-sharing-enabled -int 0

"PASSED","""2.5.3 Ensure Location Services Is Enabled"" : [PASSED]

macOS uses location information gathered through local Wi-Fi networks to enable applications to supply relevant information to users. With the operating system verifying the location, users do not need to change the time or the time zone. The computer will change them based on the user's location. They do not need to specify their location for weather or travel times and even get alerts on travel times to meetings and appointment where location information is supplied.

Location Services simplify some processes, for the purpose of asset management and time and log management, with mobile computers.

There are some use cases where it is important that the computer not be able to report its exact location. While the general use case is to enable Location Services, it should not be allowed if the physical location of the computer and the user should not be public knowledge.

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204690

Rationale:

Location Services are helpful in most use cases and can simplify log and time management where computers change time zones.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable Location Services:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Security & Privacy

Select Enable Location Services

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to enable Location Services

$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist

"PASSED","""2.6.1.4 Ensure iCloud Drive Document and Desktop Sync is Disabled - Document"" : [PASSED]

With macOS 10.12 Apple introduced the capability to have a user's Desktop and Documents folders automatically synchronize to the user's iCloud Drive, provided they have enough room purchased through Apple on their iCloud drive. This capability mirrors what Microsoft is doing with the use of OneDrive and Office 365. There are concerns with using this capability.

The storage space that Apple provides for free is used by users with iCloud mail, all of a user's Photo Library created with the ever larger Multi-Pixel iPhone cameras and all of the iOS Backups. Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more and storage may be tight without much larger Apple charges than the free 5GB. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well.

Enterprise users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third-party public cloud. In previous implementations iCloud Drive or even DropBox the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new feature synchronizes all files in a folder widely used to put working files.

The automatic synchronization of all files in a user's Desktop and Documents folders should be disabled.

https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/09/23/icloud-desktop-and-documents-in-macos-sierra-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/

The storage space that Apple provides for free is used by users with iCloud mail, all of a user's Photo Library created with the ever larger Multi-Pixel iPhone cameras and all of the iOS Backups. Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more and storage may be tight without much larger Apple charges than the free 5GB. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well.

Enterprise users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third-party public cloud. In previous implementations iCloud Drive or even DropBox the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new feature synchronizes all files in a folder widely used to put working files.

The automatic synchronization of all files in a user's Desktop and Documents folders should be disabled.

https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/09/23/icloud-desktop-and-documents-in-macos-sierra-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/

Rationale:

Automated Document synchronization should be planned and controlled to approved storage.

Impact:

Users will not be able to use iCloud for the automatic sync of the Desktop and Documents folders.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable iCloud Desktop and Document syncing:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Apple ID

Select iCloud

Select iCloud Drive

Select Options next to iCloud Drive

Uncheck Desktop & Documents Folders

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.applicationaccess

Add the key allowCloudDesktopAndDocuments

Set the key to </false>

"PASSED","""3.2 Ensure Security Auditing Flags Are Configured Per Local Organizational Requirements - 'audit successful/failed login/logout events'"" : [PASSED]

Auditing is the capture and maintenance of information about security-related events. Auditable events often depend on differing organizational requirements.

Rationale:

Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises or attacks that have occurred, have begun, or are about to begin. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised.

Depending on the governing authority, organizations can have vastly different auditing requirements. In this control we have selected a minimal set of audit flags that should be a part of any organizational requirements. The flags selected below may not adequately meet organizational requirements for users of this benchmark. The auditing checks for the flags proposed here will not impact additional flags that are selected.

Solution:
Perform the following to set the require Security Auditing Flags:
Edit the /etc/security/audit_control file and add fm, ad, -ex, aa, -fr, lo, and -fw flags or add -all to flags.

"PASSED","""4.1 Ensure Bonjour Advertising Services Is Disabled"" : [PASSED]

Bonjour is an auto-discovery mechanism for TCP/IP devices which enumerate devices and services within a local subnet. DNS on macOS is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled.

Rationale:

Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of 'I'm here!' messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices the pf or other firewall would be needed.

Impact:

Some applications, like Final Cut Studio and AirPort Base Station management, may not operate properly if the mDNSResponder is turned off.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable Bonjour Advertising:
Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable Bonjour Advertising services:

$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements -bool true

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.mDNSResponder

Add the key NoMulticastAdvertisements

Set the key to true

Additional Information:

Anything Bonjour discovers is already available on the network and probably discoverable with network scanning tools. The security benefit of disabling Bonjour for that reason is minimal.

"PASSED","""5.9 Ensure system is set to hibernate - standbydelayhigh"" : [PASSED]

In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE) macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it was not encrypted. When the system is not in use the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume the encryption keys remain in memory.

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system that is protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on as well as USB or other open device ports are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data this value might be adjusted. The desktop or would have to retain power so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked however.




MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating.

Solution:
Run the following command to set the hibernate delays and to ensure the FileVault keys are set to be destroyed on standby:

$ sudo pmset -a standbydelaylow <value<=600>
$ sudo pmset -a standbydelayhigh <value<=600>
$ sudo pmset -a highstandbythreshold <value>=90>
$ sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1
$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25

example:

$ sudo pmset -a standbydelaylow 500
$ sudo pmset -a standbydelayhigh 500
$ sudo pmset -a highstandbythreshold 100
$ sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1
$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25

"PASSED","""5.9 Ensure system is set to hibernate - DestroyFVKeyOnStandby"" : [PASSED]

In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE) macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it was not encrypted. When the system is not in use the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume the encryption keys remain in memory.

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system that is protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on as well as USB or other open device ports are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data this value might be adjusted. The desktop or would have to retain power so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked however.




MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating.

Solution:
Run the following command to set the hibernate delays and to ensure the FileVault keys are set to be destroyed on standby:

$ sudo pmset -a standbydelaylow <value<=600>
$ sudo pmset -a standbydelayhigh <value<=600>
$ sudo pmset -a highstandbythreshold <value>=90>
$ sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1
$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25

example:

$ sudo pmset -a standbydelaylow 500
$ sudo pmset -a standbydelayhigh 500
$ sudo pmset -a highstandbythreshold 100
$ sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1
$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25

"PASSED","""2.2.1 Enable 'Set time and date automatically' Is Enabled - Set time and date automatically"" : [PASSED]

Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries.

Note: If your organization has internal time servers, enter them here. Enterprise mobile devices may need to use a mix of internal and external time servers. If multiple servers are required use the Date & Time System Preference with each server separated by a space.

Rationale:

Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features.

Impact:

Apple's automatic time update solution will enable an NTP server that is not controlled by the Application Firewall. Turning on 'Set time and date automatically' allows other computers to connect to set their time and allows for exploit attempts against ntpd. It also allows for more accurate network detection and OS fingerprinting

Current testing shows scanners can easily determine the MAC address and the OS vendor. More extensive OS fingerprinting may be possible.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable the date and time to be set automatically:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Date & Time

Verify that Set date and time automatically is selected

Terminal Method:
Run the following commands to enable the date and time setting automatically:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver <your.time.server>

setNetworkTimeServer: <your.time.server>

$ sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -setusingnetworktime on

setUsingNetworkTime: On

example:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver time.apple.com

setNetworkTimeServer: time.apple.com

$ sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -setusingnetworktime on

setUsingNetworkTime: On

Run the following commands if you have not set, or need to set, a new time zone:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -listtimezones

$ sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -settimezone <selected time zone>

example:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -listtimezones

Time Zones:

"PASSED","""2.4.8 Ensure File Sharing Is Disabled - AppleFileServer"" : [PASSED]

Server Message Block (SMB), Common Internet File System (CIFS) When Windows (or possibly Linux) computers need to access file shared on a Mac, SMB/CIFS file sharing is commonly used. Apple warns that SMB sharing stores passwords is a less secure fashion than AFP sharing and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account. When sharing with SMB, each user that will access the Mac must have SMB enabled.

Rationale:

By disabling File Sharing, the remote attack surface and risk of unauthorized access to files stored on the system is reduced.

Impact:

File Sharing can be used to share documents with other users but hardened servers should be used rather than user endpoints. Turning on File Sharing increases the visibility and attack surface of a system unnecessarily.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable File Sharing:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sharing

Uncheck File Sharing

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable SMB file sharing:

$ sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.smbd

Additional Information:

macOS also supported file sharing using Apple File Protocol (AFP) until 10.15 Catalina. AFP was removed in 11.0 Big Sur.

"PASSED","""2.4.9 Ensure Remote Management Is Disabled"" : [PASSED]

Remote Management is the client portion of Apple Remote Desktop (ARD). Remote Management can be used by remote administrators to view the current screen, install software, report on, and generally manage client Macs.

The screen sharing options in Remote Management are identical to those in the Screen Sharing section. In fact, only one of the two can be configured. If Remote Management is used, refer to the Screen Sharing section above on issues regard screen sharing.

Remote Management should only be enabled when a Directory is in place to manage the accounts with access. Computers will be available on port 5900 on a macOS System and could accept connections from untrusted hosts depending on the configuration, definitely a concern for mobile systems.

Rationale:

Remote Management should only be enabled on trusted networks with strong user controls present in a Directory system. Mobile devices without strict controls are vulnerable to exploit and monitoring.

Impact:

Many organizations utilize ARD for client management.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable Remote Management:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sharing

Uncheck Remote Management

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable Remote Management:

$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -stop

"PASSED","""2.9 Ensure Power Nap Is Disabled"" : [PASSED]

This feature allows the computer to take action when the user is not present and the computer is in energy saving mode. These tools require FileVault to remain unlocked and fully rejoin known networks. This macOS feature is meant to allow the computer to resume activity as needed regardless of physical security controls.

Power Nap allows the system to stay in low power mode, especially while on battery power and periodically connect to previously named networks with stored credentials for user applications to phone home and get updates. This capability requires FileVault to remain unlocked and the use of previously joined networks to be risk accepted based on the SSID without user input.

This control has been updated to check the status on both battery and AC Power. The presence of an electrical outlet does not completely correlate with logical and physical security of the device or available networks.

Rationale:

Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access.

The use of Power Nap adds to the risk of compromised physical and logical security. The user should be able to decrypt FileVault and have the applications download what is required when the computer is actively used.

The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the Benchmark. Forcing the computer to stay on and use energy in case a management push is needed is contrary to most current management processes. Only keep computers unslept if after hours pushes are required on closed LANs.

Impact:

Power Nap exists for unattended user application updates like email and social media clients. With Power Nap disabled the computer will not wake and reconnect to known wireless SSIDs intermittently when slept.

Solution:
Perform the following disable Wake for network access or Power Nap:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Energy Saver

Uncheck Enable Power Nap

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable Power Nap:

$ sudo pmset -a powernap 0

"PASSED","""3.5 Ensure Access to Audit Records Is Controlled - /etc/security/audit_control"" : [PASSED]

The audit system on macOS writes important operational and security information that can be both useful for an attacker and a place for an attacker to attempt to obfuscate unwanted changes that were recorded. As part of defense-in-depth the /etc/security/audit_control configuration and the files in /var/audit should be owned only by root with group wheel with read-only rights and no other access allowed. macOS ACLs should not be used for these files.

Rationale:

Audit records should never be changed except by the system daemon posting events. Records may be viewed or extracts manipulated, but the authoritative files should be protected from unauthorized changes.

Impact:

This control is only checking the default configuration to ensure that unwanted access to audit records is not available.

Solution:
Run the following to commands to set the audit records to the root user and wheel group:

$ sudo chown -R root:wheel /etc/security/audit_control

$ sudo chmod -R -o-rw /etc/security/audit_control

$ sudo chown -R root:wheel /var/audit/

$ sudo chmod -R -o-rw /var/audit/

Note: It is recommended to do a thorough verification process on why the audit logs have been changed before following the remediation steps. If the system has different access controls on the audit logs, and the changes cannot be traced, a new install may be prudent. Check for signs of file tampering as well as unapproved OS changes.

"PASSED","""4.2 Ensure Show Wi-Fi status in Menu Bar Is Enabled - Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar"" : [PASSED]

The Wi-Fi status in the menu bar indicates if the system's wireless internet capabilities are enabled. If so, the system will scan for available wireless networks to connect to. At the time of this revision all computers Apple builds have wireless network capability, which has not always been the case. This control only pertains to systems that have a wireless NIC available. Operating systems running in a virtual environment may not score as expected either.

Rationale:

Enabling 'Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar' is a security awareness method that helps mitigate public area wireless exploits by making the user aware of their wireless connectivity status.

Impact:

The user of the system should have a quick check on their wireless network status available.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable Wi-Fi status in the menu bar:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Dock & Menu Bar

Select Wi-Fi

Set Show in Menu Bar

Terminal Method:
For each user, run the following to turn the Wi-Fi status on in the menu bar

$ sudo -u <username> defaults -currentHost write com.apple.controlcenter.plist WiFi -int 18

example:

$ sudo -u firstuser defaults -currentHost write com.apple.controlcenter.plist WiFi -int 18

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.controlcenter

Add the key WiFi

Set the key to <integer>18</integer>

Additional Information:

AirPort is Apple's marketing name for its 802.11b, g, and n wireless interfaces.

"PASSED","""5.1.2 Ensure System Integrity Protection Status (SIPS) Is Enabled"" : [PASSED]

System Integrity Protection is a security feature introduced in OS X 10.11 El Capitan. System Integrity Protection restricts access to System domain locations and restricts runtime attachment to system processes. Any attempt to inspect or attach to a system process will fail. Kernel Extensions are now restricted to /Library/Extensions and are required to be signed with a Developer ID.

Rationale:

Running without System Integrity Protection on a production system runs the risk of the modification of system binaries or code injection of system processes that would otherwise be protected by SIP.

Impact:

System binaries and processes could become compromised.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable System Integrity Protection:

Reboot into the Recovery Partition (reboot and hold down Command + R)

Select Utilities

Select Terminal

Run the following command:

$ sudo /usr/bin/csrutil enable

Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.



Reboot the computer

Note: You cannot enable System Integrity Protection from the booted operating system. If the remediation is attempted in the booted OS and not the Recovery Partition the output will give the error csrutil: failed to modify system integrity configuration. This tool needs to be executed from the Recovery OS.

"PASSED","""5.1.5 Ensure Sealed System Volume (SSV) Is Enabled"" : [PASSED]

Sealed System Volume is a security feature introduced in macOS 11.0 Big Sur.

During system installation, a SHA-256 cryptographic hash is calculated for all immutable system files and stored in a Merkle tree which itself is hashed as the Seal. Both are stored in the metadata of the snapshot created of the System volume.

The seal is verified by the boot loader at startup. macOS will not boot if system files have been tampered with. If validation fails, the user will be instructed to reinstall the operating system.

During read operations for files located in the Sealed System Volume, a hash is calculated and compared to the value stored in the Merkle tree.

Rationale:

Running without Sealed System Volume on a production system could run the risk of Apple software, that integrates directly with macOS, being modified.

Impact:

Apple Software that integrates with the operating system could become compromised.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable System Integrity Protection:

Reboot into the Recovery Partition (reboot and hold down Command + R)

Select an administrator's account and enter that account's password

Select Utilities

Select Terminal

Run the following command:

$ sudo /usr/bin/csrutil enable authenticated-root

Applications in the System Applications Directory (/Applications) should be world executable since that is their reason to be on the system. They should not be world-writable and allow any process or user to alter them for other processes or users to then execute modified versions.

Rationale:

Unauthorized modifications of applications could lead to the execution of malicious code.

Impact:

Applications changed will no longer be world-writable.

Solution:
Run the following command to change the permissions for each application that does not meet the requirements:

$ sudo /bin/chmod -R o-w /Applications/<applicationname>

"PASSED","""5.4 Ensure a Separate Timestamp Is Enabled for Each User/tty Combo"" : [PASSED]

Using tty tickets ensures that a user must enter the sudo password in each Terminal session.

With sudo versions 1.8 and higher, introduced in 10.12, the default value is to have tty tickets for each interface so that root access is limited to a specific terminal. The default configuration can be overwritten or not configured correctly on earlier versions of macOS.

Rationale:

In combination with removing the sudo timeout grace period, a further mitigation should be in place to reduce the possibility of a background process using elevated rights when a user elevates to root in an explicit context or tty.

Additional mitigation should be in place to reduce the risk of privilege escalation of background processes.

Impact:

This control should have no user impact. Developers or installers may have issues if background processes are spawned with different interfaces than where sudo was executed.

Solution:
Edit the /etc/sudoers file with visudo and remove !tty_tickets from any Defaults line. If there is a Default line of timestamp_type= with a value other than tty, change the value to tty
If there is a file in the /etc/sudoers.d/ folder that contains Defaults !tty_tickets, edit the file and remove !tty_tickets from any Defaults line. If there is a file /etc/sudoers.d/ folder that contains a Default line of timestamp_type= with a value other than tty, change the value to tty

Default Value:

If no value is set, the default value of tty_tickets enabled will be used.

"PASSED","""5.14 Do not enter a password-related hint"" : [PASSED]

Password hints help the user recall their passwords for various systems and/or accounts. In most cases, password hints are simple and closely related to the user's password.

Rationale:

Password hints that are closely related to the user's password are a security vulnerability, especially in the social media age. Unauthorized users are more likely to guess a user's password if there is a password hint. The password hint is very susceptible to social engineering attacks and information exposure on social media networks.

Solution:
Perform the following to remove a user's password hint:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Users & Groups

Select the Current User

Select Change Password

Change the password and ensure that no text is entered in the Password hint box

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to remove a user's password hint:

$ sudo dscl . -delete /Users/<username> hint

example:

$ sudo dscl . -delete /Users/firstuser hint

$ sudo dscl . -delete /Users/seconduser hint

Additional Information:

Organizations might consider entering an organizational help desk phone number or other text (such as a warning to the user). A help desk number is only appropriate for organizations with trained help desk personnel that are validating user identities for password resets.

"PASSED","""6.1.3 Ensure Guest Account Is Disabled"" : [PASSED]

The guest account allows users access to the system without having to create an account or password. Guest users are unable to make setting changes cannot remotely login to the system. All files, caches, and passwords created by the guest user are deleted upon logging out.

Rationale:

Disabling the guest account mitigates the risk of an untrusted user doing basic reconnaissance and possibly using privilege escalation attacks to take control of the system.

Impact:

A guest user can use that access to find out additional information about the system and might be able to use privilege escalation vulnerabilities to establish greater access.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable guest account availability:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Users & Groups

Select Guest User

Uncheck Allow guests to log in to this computer

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable the guest account:

$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow GuestEnabled -bool false

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.loginwindow

Add the key DisableGuestAccount

Set the key to </true>

Add the key EnableGuestAccount

Set the key to </false>

Additional Information:

By default, the guest account is enabled for access to sharing services but is not allowed to log in to the computer.

The guest account does not need a password when it is enabled to log in to the computer.

"PASSED","""6.1.5 Remove Guest home folder"" : [PASSED]

In the previous two controls the guest account login has been disabled and sharing to guests has been disabled as well. There is no need for the legacy Guest home folder to remain in the file system. When normal user accounts are removed you have the option to archive it, leave it in place or delete. In the case of the guest folder the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed it will be re-created. The presence of the Guest home folder can cause automated audits to fail when looking for compliant settings within all User folders as well. Rather than ignoring the folder's continued existence, it is best removed.

Rationale:

The Guest home folders are unneeded after the Guest account is disabled and could be used inappropriately.

Impact:

The Guest account should not be necessary after it is disabled, and it will be automatically re-created if the Guest account is re-enabled

Solution:
Run the following command to remove the Guest user home folder:

Run the following command in Terminal:

$ sudo rm -R /Users/Guest

"WARNING","""1.7 Audit Computer Name"" : [WARNING]

If the computer is used in an organization that assigns host names, it is a good idea to change the computer name to the host name. This is more of a best practice than a security measure. If the host name and the computer name are the same, computer support may be able to track problems down more easily.

Standard naming patterns avoid collisions and mitigate risk for computer users.

With mobile devices using DHCP IP tracking has serious drawbacks; hostname or computer name tracking makes much more sense for those organizations that can implement it. If the computer is using different names for the 'Computer Name' DNS and Directory environments it can be difficult to manage Macs in an Enterprise asset inventory.

Rationale:

Part of IT security is having visibility into all of the devices that the organization is responsible for. Without a complete inventory it is impossible to ensure all security controls are met on all organizational devices.

Default macOS naming deconfliction controls can create issues for appropriate management and tracking as well as privacy exposure. By default the name of a macOS computer is derived from the first user created. If the user has multiple computers or an image is used without an appropriate name change there will be multiple computers with names derived from the same user for discovery deconfliction. How many 'Ron Colvin's MacBook Pro' should there be, are any missing?

Local network auto renaming to avoid collisions also allows for the enumeration of local computer names. Computers should not be named after their users, especially on untrusted networks. For social engineering purposes the computer name should not provide a full name of the user or an identifiable name that might be used to assist in targeted user attacks.

A documented plan to better enable a complete device inventory without exposing user or organizational information is part of mature security.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

"WARNING","""2.5.4 Audit Location Services Access"" : [WARNING]

macOS uses location information gathered through local Wi-Fi networks to enable applications to supply relevant information to users. While Location Services may be very useful, it may not be desirable to allow all applications that can use Location Services to use your location for Internet queries to provide tailored content based on your current location.

Ensure that the applications that can use Location Services are authorized to use that information and provide that information where the application interacts with external systems. Apple provides feedback within System Preferences and may be enabled to provide information on the menu bar when Location Services are used.

Safari can deny access from websites or prompt for access.

Applications that support Location Services can be individually controlled in the Privacy tab in Security & Privacy under System Preferences.

Access should be evaluated to ensure that privacy controls are as expected.

Rationale:

Privacy controls should be monitored for appropriate settings.

Impact:

Many macOS services rely on Location Services for tailored services. Users expect their time zone and weather to be relevant to where they are without manual intervention. Find my Mac does need to know where your Mac actually is. Where possible the tolerance between location privacy and convenience may be best left to the user when the location itself is not sensitive. If facility locations are not public location information should be tightly controlled.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable unnecessary applications from accessing Location Services:

Open System Preferences

Select Security & Privacy

Select Privacy

Select Location Services

Uncheck applications that are not approved for access to Location Service information

Perform the following to set websites to ask for permission to access Location Services:

"WARNING","""2.5.7 Audit Camera Privacy and Confidentiality"" : [WARNING]

If the computer is present in an area where there are privacy concerns or sensitive images or actions are taking place the camera should be covered at those times. A permanent cover or alteration may be required when the computer is always located in a confidential area.

Malware is continuously discovered that circumvents the privacy controls of the built-in camera. No computer has perfect security and it seems likely that even if all the drivers are disabled or removed that working drivers can be re-introduced by a determined attacker.

Rationale:

At this point video chatting and other uses of the built-in camera are standard uses for a computer. In cases where the camera is not allowed to be used at all or when the computer is located in private areas additional precautions are warranted. OS components used for the built-in video camera can also be used for other connected cameras, whether USB or Bluetooth. Removed OS components that enable a camera may be re-installed or re-enabled.

The General rule should be that if the camera can capture images that could cause embarrassment or an adverse impact the camera should be covered until it is appropriate to use.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to set the camera settings to your organization's requirements:
Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.applicationaccess

Add the key allowCamera

Set the key to </true> or </false> based on your organization's preference

**Note:**There is no supported method from Apple to enable/disable the built-in FaceTime camera through the GUI or the command line. Remove any external cameras based on your organization's policies.

Additional Information:

There should be no hardware modifications done to the computers to remove any built-in FaceTime cameras.

WARNING"
"WARNING","""2.6.1.1 Audit iCloud Configuration"" : [WARNING]

Apple's iCloud is a consumer-oriented service that allows a user to store data as well as find, control and backup devices that are associated with their Apple ID (Apple account). The use of iCloud on Enterprise devices should align with the acceptable use policy for devices that are managed as well as confidentiality requirements for data handled by the user. If iCloud is allowed the data that is copied to Apple servers will likely be duplicated on both personal as well as Enterprise devices.

For many users the Enterprise email system may replace many of the available features in iCloud. If using either an Exchange or Google environment email, calendars, notes and contacts can sync to the official Enterprise repository and be available through multiple devices.

Depending on workplace requirements it may not be appropriate to intermingle Enterprise and personal bookmarks, photos and documents. Since the service allows every device associated with the user's ID to synchronize and have access to the cloud storage the concern is not just about having sensitive data on Apple's servers but having that same data on the phone of the teenage son or daughter of an employee. The use of family sharing options can reduce the risk.

Apple's iCloud is just one of many cloud-based solutions being used for data synchronization across multiple platforms and it should be controlled consistently with other cloud services in your environment. Work with your employees and configure the access to best enable data protection for your mission.

Rationale:

Organizations must make a risk decision on how their computers will interact with public cloud services.

Impact:

iCloud services are integrated deeply into macOS and in many cases are expected to be used by Mac users. iCloud is a public cloud and is not covered by an organizational security plan. In many cases synchronizing user data from an organizational computer to an uncontrolled location, no matter who is the data owner, is unacceptable.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable unapproved services:

Open System Preferences

Select Apple ID

Select iCloud

Uncheck any services that are not allowed for your organization

Use a profile to disable services where organizationally required.

"WARNING","""2.6.1.2 Audit iCloud Keychain"" : [WARNING]

The iCloud keychain is Apple's password manager that works with macOS and iOS. The capability allows users to store passwords in either iOS or macOS for use in Safari on both platforms and other iOS-integrated applications. The most pervasive use is driven by iOS use rather than macOS. The passwords stored in a macOS keychain on an Enterprise-managed computer could be stored in Apple's cloud and then be available on a personal computer using the same account. The stored passwords could be for organizational as well as for personal accounts.

If passwords are no longer being used as organizational tokens they are not in scope for iCloud keychain storage.

Rationale:

Ensure that the iCloud keychain is used consistently with organizational requirements.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to set iCloud keychain sync based on your organization's requirements:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select iCloud

Uncheck (or check) Keychain to meet your organization's requirements

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.applicationaccess

Add the key allowCloudKeychainSync

Set the key to your organization's requirements

Note: iCloud Keychain and iCloud Drive must be set in a single configuration profile.

"WARNING","""2.6.1.3 Audit iCloud Drive"" : [WARNING]

iCloud Drive is Apple's storage solution for applications on both macOS and iOS to use the same files that are resident in Apple's cloud storage. The iCloud Drive folder is available much like Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive.

One of the concerns in public cloud storage is that proprietary data may be inappropriately stored in an end user's personal repository. Organizations that need specific controls on information should ensure that this service is turned off or the user knows what information must be stored on services that are approved for storage of controlled information.

Rationale:

Organizations should review third party storage solutions pertaining to existing data confidentiality and integrity requirements.

Impact:

Users will not be able to use continuity on macOS to resume the use of newly composed but unsaved files

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to set iCloud Drive to your organization's requirements:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Apple ID

"WARNING","""2.6.2 Audit App Store Password Settings"" : [WARNING]

With OS X 10.11 Apple added settings for password storage for the App Store in macOS. These settings parallel the settings in iOS. As with iOS the choices are a requirement to provide a password after every purchase or to have a 15-minute grace period, and whether to require a password for free purchases. The response to this setting is stored in a cookie and processed by iCloud.

There is plenty of risk information on the wisdom of this setting for parents with children buying games on iPhones and iPads. The most relevant information here is the likelihood that users that are not authorized to download software may have physical access to an unlocked computer where someone who is authorized recently made a purchase. If that is a concern a password should be required at all times for App Store access in the Password Settings controls.

WARNING"
"WARNING","""3.7 Audit Software Inventory"" : [WARNING]

With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple added a new application, App Store, which resides in the Applications directory. This application allows a user with admin privileges and an Apple ID to browse Apple's online App Store, purchase (including no cost purchases), and install new applications, bypassing Enterprise software inventory controls. Any admin user can install software in the /Applications directory whether from internet downloads, thumb drives, optical media, cloud storage or even binaries through email. Even standard users can run executables downloaded to their home folder by default. The source of the software is not nearly as important as a consistent audit of all installed software for patch compliance and appropriateness.

A single user desktop where the user, administrator and the person approving software are all the same person probably does not need to audit software inventory to this extent. It is helpful in the case of stability problems or malware however.

Scan systems on a monthly basis and determine the number of unauthorized pieces of software that are installed. Verify that if an unauthorized piece of software is found one month, it is removed from the system the next.

Export System Information through the built-in System Information Application or other third-party tools on an organizationally defined timetable.

Rationale:

Part of comprehensive IT security involves device management and ensuring that all software is authorized and patched. Checking for macOS updates and app updates are relatively simple for the end user and can even be updated with minimal privileges from trusted sources if enabled. Remote monitoring of the patch status for software maintained through Apple is very well supported by management applications. Neither Apple capabilities nor third-party patch management solutions will cover all mission necessary software for most organizations. Full visibility into software present on the system enables vulnerability and risk management.

PS Don't forget about browser plugins/extensions for all installed software.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Delete any unnecessary applications from the system.

WARNING"
"WARNING","""4.3 Audit Network Specific Locations"" : [WARNING]

The network location feature of the Mac is a very powerful tool to manage network security. By creating different network locations, a user can easily (and without administrative privileges) change the network settings on the Mac. By only using the network interfaces needed at any specific time, exposure to network attacks is limited.

A little understanding of how the Network System Preferences pane works is required.

Rationale:

Network locations allow the computer to have specific configurations ready for network access when required. Locations can be used to manage which network interfaces are available for specialized network access.

Impact:

Unneeded network interfaces increase the attack surface and could lead to a successful exploit.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following actions to create and edit multiple network locations as needed:

Open System Preferences

Select Network

Select Location

Select Edit Locations from the Locations popup menu

Select any unneeded network locations

Click the minus button for any unneeded locations

Select Done

Select any remaining network locations

Select any unneeded network interfaces

Select the minus button to remove them

Note: Delete the Automatic location for any device that does not use multiple network services set for DHCP or dynamic addressing. If network services like FireWire, VPN, AirPort or Ethernet are not used by a specific device class those services should be deleted.

Additional Information:

Deleting the Automatic location cannot be undone.

"WARNING","""4.6 Audit Wi-Fi Settings"" : [WARNING]

Some organizations have comprehensive rules that cover the use of wireless technologies in order to implement operational security. There are specific policies governing the use of both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (802.11) that often include disabling the wireless capability in either software or hardware or both.

Wireless access is part of the feature set required for mobile computers and is considered essential for most users.

Rationale:

The general use case for macOS is to use wireless connectivity. In the current hardware offering very few computers made by Apple provide a built-in wired network capability. While it is possible to get an ethernet adapter for wired connectivity it is not the default. The almost exclusive Apple use case is to support mobile connectivity for users of their devices through wireless connections. For use cases that wireless connectivity is not allowed an Apple model with built-in ethernet is the best option. Wireless can be turned off in those situations in the network system preference pane.

"WARNING","""7.1 Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) password"" : [WARNING]

EFI is the software link between the motherboard hardware and the software operating system. EFI determines which partition or disk to load macOS from, and it also determines whether the user can enter single user mode. The main reasons to set a firmware password have been protections against an alternative boot disk, protection against a passwordless root shell through single user mode and protection against firewire DMA attacks. While it was easier in the past to reset the firmware password by removing RAM, it did make tampering slightly harder because having to remove RAM remediated memory scraping attacks through DMA. It has always been difficult to manage the firmware password on macOS computers, though some tools did make it much easier.

Apple patched OS X in 10.7 to mitigate the DMA attacks, and the use of FileVault 2 Full-Disk Encryption mitigates the risk of damage to the boot volume if an unauthorized user uses a different boot volume or uses single user mode. Apple's reliance on the recovery partition and the additional features it provides make controls that do not allow the user to boot into the recovery partition less attractive.

Starting in late 2010 with the MacBook Air Apple has slowly updated the requirements to recover from a lost firmware password. Apple only supports taking the computer to an Apple authorized service provider. This change makes managing the firmware password effectively more critical if it is used.

Setting the firmware password may be a good practice in some environments. We cannot recommend it as a standard security practice at this time.

http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/booting-into-single-user-mode-on-a-filevault-2-encrypted-mac/




Impact:

In environments where strict processes are mandated for change control, allowing the user to boot to recovery and possibly change configurations on the boot volume will be unacceptable. The risk analysis for this control is that the user of the computer already has login rights, decryption rights, and access to user data. In most known use cases device management controls will be sufficient to mitigate and discover insider threat control circumvention. Some organizations will not accept the risk of even temporary control changes on devices and may need set an EFI password to block unauthorized changes even from trusted insiders.

"WARNING","""7.2 FileVault and Local Account Password Reset using AppleID"" : [WARNING]

Apple has provided services for several years that allowed a user to reset a local account password on a computer using their Apple ID and a service to store the FileVault Master Password with Apple that would be controlled by access to an Apple ID. These distinct services have been more cleanly integrated starting in 10.12.

This integrated service for password and decryption is a concern in enterprise environments. Normal enterprise management controls mitigate the risk of external control of organizational systems. The user of the system already has the ability to unlock the disk in order to log in and use it and some form of password recovery function is likely already in place for any approved accounts. In addition:

You cannot reset anything but a local account

You need physical access to the computer on a network that can phone home to Apple

Enterprise FileVault management precludes the use of Apple's personal encryption recovery tied to a User's Apple ID

The current login keychain will have to be discarded unless the user remembers the old password

This service allows for organizational computer users to utilize AppleIDs for encryption key escrow and user account management. The use of Apple's services rather than enterprise services may be considered inappropriate.

"WARNING","""2.13 Audit Siri Settings"" : [WARNING]

With macOS 10.12 Sierra Apple has introduced Siri from iOS to macOS. While there are data spillage concerns with the use of data gathering personal assistant software, the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches, Siri could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed. This appears be a usage edge case.

In cases where sensitive and protected data is processed and Siri could help a user navigate their machine and expose that information it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of its requirements.

Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than already approved activity.

For information on Apple's privacy policy for Siri, click here.

Rationale:

Where 'normal' user activity is already limited, Siri use should be controlled as well.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to set Siri to your organization's parameters:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Siri

Select the settings that are within your organization's requirements

Terminal Method:
Run the following commands to enable or disable Siri settings:

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.assistant.support.plist 'Assistant Enabled' -bool <true/false>

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.Siri.plist LockscreenEnabled -bool <true/false>

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.Siri.plist StatusMenuVisible -bool <true/false>

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.Siri.plist VoiceTriggerUserEnabled -bool <true/false>

After running the default writes, the Windows Server needs to be restarted and the caches cleared. Run the following commands to perform that action:

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall -HUP cfprefsd

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall SystemUIServer




example:

$ sudo -u firstuser /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.assistant.support.plist 'Assistant Enabled' -bool true

$ sudo -u firstuser /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.Siri.plist StatusMenuVisible -bool true

$ sudo -u firstuser /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.Siri.plist LockscreenEnabled -bool false

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall -HUP cfprefsd

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall SystemUIServer

$ sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.assistant.support.plist 'Assistant Enabled' -bool false

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall -HUP cfprefsd

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall SystemUIServer

$ sudo -u thirduser /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.Siri.plist VoiceTriggerUserEnabled -bool false

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall -HUP cfprefsd

$ sudo /usr/bin/killall SystemUIServer

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.applicationaccess

Add the key allowAssistant

Set the key to </true> or </false> based on your organization's requirements

Note: Siri can only be enabled or disabled through configuration profiles. Any additional settings need to be set through the GUI of CLI

"WARNING","""2.14 Audit Sidecar Settings"" : [WARNING]

Apple introduced a technology called Sidecar with the release of mac OS 10.15 'Catalina' that allows the use of an Apple iPad as an additional screen. There are no known security issues with the use of Sidecar at the time of the publication of this Benchmark. There are security concerns with some of the underlying technology that allows this feature to work. The Apple support article below has the additional requirements that are reproduced below. So while Sidecar may not have an explicit security concern some organizations may have requirements that block the use of the features required to allow Sidecar to work.

https://support.apple.com/en-afri/HT210380

Additional requirements

Both devices must be signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID using two-factor authentication.

To use Sidecar wirelessly, both devices must be within 10 meters (30 feet) of each other and have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff turned on. Also make sure that the iPad is not sharing its cellular connection and the Mac is not sharing its Internet connection.

To use Sidecar over USB, make sure that your iPad is set to trust your Mac.

Organizations that do not allow the use of iCloud and more specifically Handoff will not be able to use Sidecar.

Some organizations may not allow the use of mixed ownership for P2P wireless or USB connections so that unless the organization controls both the Mac and the iPad connections may not be approved and the use of a single Apple ID for distinctly managed devices may be prohibited.

Rationale:

Organizations need to have an understanding of integration of organizational and personal inventory in the work environment.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to set Sidecar to your organization's parameters:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sidecar

Select the settings that are within your organization's parameters

Terminal Method:
Run the following to enable or disable Sidecar settings:

$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.sidecar.display AllowAllDevices <true/false>

$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.sidecar.display hasShownPref <true/false>

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the key of com.apple.sidecar.display under PayloadContent

Add the following set of keys with the com.apple.Bluetooth key:

<dict>
<key>Forced</key>
<array>

WARNING"
"WARNING","""2.15 Audit Touch ID and Wallet & Apple Pay Settings"" : [WARNING]

Apple has integrated Touch ID with macOS and allows fingerprint use for many common operations. All use of Touch ID requires the presence of a password and the use of that password after every reboot or where it has been more than 48 hours since the device was last unlocked.

Touch ID is a pre-requisite for using Apple Pay and Wallet on macOS. Apple Pay allows an Apple account holder to enroll their credit cards in Apple Pay and pay enrolled vendors without using the physical card or number. Apple's service eliminates the requirement to send the credit card number itself to the vendor. Apple Pay on a Mac allows the use of credit cards the user has already enrolled and reduces user risk for credit card purchases.

Rationale:

Touch ID allows for an account enrolled fingerprint to access a key that uses a previously provided password.

Some environments may have rules around purchases from organizationally managed computers and may want to discourage shopping from them. It is difficult to block access to websites that allow purchases and Apple Pay has additional controls for user protection than the manually entry of credit card information

Impact:

Touch ID is more convenient for use with aggressive screen lock controls.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to set Touch ID to your organization's settings:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Touch ID

Select the Touch ID settings match your organization's settings

Open System Preferences

Select Wallet & Apple Pay

Select the Wallet & Apple Pay settings match your organization's settings

"WARNING","""2.16 Audit Notification System Preference Settings"" : [WARNING]

Notification capabilities are designed to allow users to receive updates from applications that are not currently in use, these can be background applications or even notices from processes running on a computer that is not currently being actively used. Where the screen of a computer is visible to others other than the logged-in user due to shared working spaces or public spaces consideration should be made on the exposure of sensitive data in notifications. Applications that use the system-wide application service may be individually managed and applications that might expose confidential information to unauthorized users should not expose notifications except to the current user, especially on the locked screen when the computer may be unattended.

Rationale:

Some work environments will handle sensitive or confidential information with applications that can provide notifications to anyone that can see the computer screen. Organizations must review the likelihood that information may be exposed inappropriately and suppress notifications where risk is not organizationally accepted.

Impact:

Computer users are often juggling too much information through too many applications that want their attention and are often designed to get attention and not ever let it go. Notifications are a mechanism that can be used to cut through the deluge and allow important issues to be resolved in a timely way. Global controls on limiting user notifications, even for certain applications, could impact productivity and the timely remediation of issues.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to set Notifications to your organization's requirements:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Notifications

"WARNING","""5.8 Ensure a Password is Required to Wake the Computer From Sleep or Screen Saver Is Enabled"" : [WARNING]

Sleep and screensaver modes are low power modes that reduce electrical consumption while the system is not in use.

Rationale:

Prompting for a password when waking from sleep or screensaver mode mitigates the threat of an unauthorized person gaining access to a system in the user's absence.

Impact:

Without a screenlock in place anyone with physical access to the computer would be logged in and able to use the active user's session.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable a password for unlock after a screen saver begins or after sleep:
Graphical Method:

Auditing is the capture and maintenance of information about security-related events. Auditable events often depend on differing organizational requirements.

Rationale:

Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises or attacks that have occurred, have begun, or are about to begin. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised.

Depending on the governing authority, organizations can have vastly different auditing requirements. In this control we have selected a minimal set of audit flags that should be a part of any organizational requirements. The flags selected below may not adequately meet organizational requirements for users of this benchmark. The auditing checks for the flags proposed here will not impact additional flags that are selected.

"FAILED","""5.5 Ensure login keychain is locked when the computer sleeps"" : [FAILED]

The login keychain is a secure database store for passwords and certificates and is created for each user account on macOS. The system software itself uses keychains for secure storage. Anyone with physical access to an unlocked keychain where the screen is also unlocked can copy all passwords in that keychain. The approach recommended here is that the login keychain be set to lock when the computer sleeps to reduce the risk of password exposure. Organizations that use Firefox and Thunderbird will have a much different tolerance than those organizations using keychain aware applications extensively.

In previous versions of the Benchmark there were recommendations for inactivity timeouts and maintaining individual keychains. The user experience with a short inactivity timeout is difficult. Users will be unlocking the keychain often to all keychain aware applications access. This benchmark lengthened the inactivity timeout substantially in the past to keep the inactivity control. At this time it has been dropped. The compensating controls of a screen lock, lock when sleeping, and the built-in keychain encryption make the control allows for a small residual risk.

Early guidance, including in this Benchmark, recommended the use of additional keychains as needed to separate confidentiality levels or separate user domains (work, school, volunteer groups...) At his point, particularly with the availability of iCloud Keychain key segregation is a niche use case. Recent recommendations on distinct keychains is very rare.

Rationale:

While logged in, the keychain does not prompt the user for passwords for various systems and/or programs. This can be exploited by unauthorized users to gain access to password-protected programs and/or systems in the absence of the user.

Impact:

The user may experience multiple prompts to unlock the keychain when waking from sleep.

Solution:
Perform the following to set the login keychain to lock on sleep:
Graphical Method:

Open Keychain Access

Select the login keychain

Select Edit

Select Change Settings for keychain login

Set Lock when sleeping

Terminal Method:
For each user, run the following command to set the login keychain to sleep on lock:

$ sudo -u <username> security  set-keychain-settings -l /Users/<username>/Library/Keychains/login.keychain

example:

$ sudo -u firstuser security set-keychain-settings -l /Users/firstuser/Library/Keychains/login.keychain

"FAILED","""5.15 Ensure Fast User Switching Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

Fast user switching allows a person to quickly log in to the computer with a different account. While only a minimal security risk, when a second user is logged in, that user might be able to see what processes the first user is using, or possibly gain other information about the first user. In a large directory environment where it is difficult to limit log in access many valid users can login to other user's assigned computers.

Rationale:

Fast user switching allows multiple users to run applications simultaneously at console. There can be information disclosed about processes running under a different user. Without a specific configuration to save data and log out users can have unsaved data running in a background session that is not obvious.

Impact:

When support staff visits a user's computer console, they will not be able to log in to their own session if there is an active and locked session.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable fast user switching:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Users & Groups

Select Login Options

Uncheck 'Show fast user switching menu as...'

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to turn fast user switching off:

$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences MultipleSessionEnabled -bool false

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of .GlobalPreferences

Add the key MultipleSessionEnabled

Set the key to </false>

Additional Information:

macOS is a multi-user operating system, and there are other similar methods that might provide the same kind of risk. The Remote Login service that can be turned on in the Sharing System Preferences pane is another.

"FAILED","""1.6 Ensure Install of macOS Updates Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

Ensure that macOS updates are installed after they are available from Apple. This setting enables macOS updates to be automatically installed. Some environments will want to approve and test updates before they are delivered. It is best practice to test first where updates can and have caused disruptions to operations. Automatic updates should be turned off where changes are tightly controlled and there are mature testing and approval processes. Automatic updates should not be turned off so the admin can call the users first to let them know it's ok to install. A dependable, repeatable process involving a patch agent or remote management tool should be in place before auto-updates are turned off.

"FAILED","""2.1.1 Turn off Bluetooth, if no paired devices exist"" : [FAILED]

Bluetooth devices use a wireless communications system that replaces the cables used by other peripherals to connect to a system. It is by design a peer-to-peer network technology and typically lacks centralized administration and security enforcement infrastructure.

Rationale:

Bluetooth is particularly susceptible to a diverse set of security vulnerabilities involving identity detection, location tracking, denial of service, unintended control and access of data and voice channels, and unauthorized device control and data access.

Impact:

There have been many Bluetooth exploits. While Bluetooth can be hardened, it does create a local wireless network that can be attacked to compromise both devices and information. Apple has emphasized the ease of use in Bluetooth devices so it is generally expected that Bluetooth will be used. Turning off Bluetooth with this control will also disable the Bluetooth sharing capability that is more strongly recommended against in control 2.4.7.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable Bluetooth:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Bluetooth

Select Turn Bluetooth Off

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable Bluetooth

$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 0

$ sudo killall -HUP bluetoothd

Note: When using the terminal method to disable Bluetooth, the prescribed state will not be properly shown in the GUI. Use the terminal method of the audit to verify if Bluetooth is enabled/disabled.

"FAILED","""2.1.2 Ensure Show Bluetooth Status in Menu Bar Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

By showing the Bluetooth status in the menu bar, a small Bluetooth icon is placed in the menu bar. This icon quickly shows the status of Bluetooth, and can allow the user to quickly turn Bluetooth on or off.

Rationale:

Enabling 'Show Bluetooth status in menu bar' is a security awareness method that helps understand the current state of Bluetooth, including whether it is enabled, discoverable, what paired devices exist, and what paired devices are currently active.

Impact:

Bluetooth is a useful wireless tool that has been widely exploited when configured improperly. The user should have insight into the Bluetooth status.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable Bluetooth status in the menu bar:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Dock & Menu Bar

Select Bluetooth

"FAILED","""2.2.2 Ensure time set is within appropriate limits"" : [FAILED]

Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Ensure that time on the computer is within acceptable limits. Truly accurate time is measured within milliseconds. For this audit, a drift under four and a half minutes passes the control check. Since Kerberos is one of the important features of macOS integration into Directory systems the guidance here is to warn you before there could be an impact to operations. From the perspective of accurate time, this check is not strict,so it may be too great for your organization. Your organization can adjust to a smaller offset value as needed.

Note: ntpdate has been deprecated with 10.14. sntp replaces that command.

Rationale:

Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features. Audit check is for more than 4 minutes and 30 seconds ahead or behind.

Impact:

Accurate time is required for many computer functions.

Solution:
Run the following commands to ensure your time is set within an appropriate limit:

$ sudo systemsetup -getnetworktimeserver

The output will include Network Time Server: and the name of your time server
example: Network Time Server: time.apple.com.

$ sudo touch /var/db/ntp-kod

$ sudo chown root:wheel /var/db/ntp-kod

$ sudo sntp -sS <your.time.server>

example:

$ sudo systemsetup -getnetworktimeserver

Network Time Server: time.apple.com

$ sudo touch /var/db/ntp-kod

$ sudo chown root:wheel /var/db/ntp-kod

$ sudo sntp -sS time.apple.com

"FAILED","""2.3.1 Ensure an Inactivity Interval of 20 Minutes Or Less for the Screen Saver Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

A locking screensaver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS, the screensaver starts after a value is selected in the drop down menu. 20 minutes or less is an acceptable value. Any value can be selected through the command line or script but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts.

Rationale:

Setting an inactivity interval for the screensaver prevents unauthorized persons from viewing a system left unattended for an extensive period of time.

Impact:

If the screensaver is not set users may leave the computer available for an unauthorized person to access information.

Solution:
Perform the following to set the screen saver to activate in 20 minutes of less:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Desktop & Screen Saver

Select Screen Saver

Select on option for Start after that is 20 minutes or less (<=1200)

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to verify that the idle time of the screen saver is set to 20 minutes of less (<=1200)

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int <value <=1200>

example:

$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int 600

If there are multiple users out of compliance with the prescribed setting, run this command for each user to set their idle time:

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int <value <=1200>

example:

$ sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int 600

$ sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost read com.apple.screensaver idleTime

600

**Note:**Issues arise if the command line is used to make the setting something other than what is available in the GUI Menu. Choose either 1 (60), 2 (120), 5 (300), 10 (600), or 20 (120) minutes to avoid any issues.
Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.screensaver.user

"FAILED","""2.3.3 Audit Lock Screen and Start Screen Saver Tools"" : [FAILED]

In 10.13 Apple added a 'Lock Screen' option to the Apple Menu. Prior to this the best quick lock options were to use either a lock screen option with the screen saver or the lock screen option from Keychain Access if status was made available in the menu bar. With 10.13 the menu bar option is no longer available. The intent of this control is to resemble control-alt-delete on Windows Systems as a means of quickly locking the screen. If the user of the system is stepping away from the computer the best practice is to lock the screen and setting a hot corner is an appropriate method.

Rationale:

Ensuring the user has a quick method to lock their screen may reduce the opportunity for individuals in close physical proximity of the device to see screen contents.

Solution:
Perform the following to set a Hot Corner to either Start Screen Saver or Put Display to Sleep:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Desktop & Screen Saver

Select Screen Saver

Select Hot Corners... and turn on either/both Start Screen Saver or Put Display to Sleep

Terminal Method:
For all users, run the following commands to set Start Screen Saver or Put Display to Sleep as a Hot Corner:

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults read com.apple.dock <corner> -int <5 or 10>

example:

$ sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-tl-corner -int 10

$ sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults read com.apple.dock wvous-tl-corner

10

$ sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-bl-corner -int 5

$ sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults read com.apple.dock wvous-bl-corner

10




Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.dock

Add the key Forced

Set the key to the following (based on the corner(s) that your organization has selected):

"FAILED","""2.4.3 Ensure Screen Sharing Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

Screen Sharing allows a computer to connect to another computer on a network and display the computer's screen. While sharing the computer's screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer.

Rationale:

Disabling Screen Sharing mitigates the risk of remote connections being made without the user of the console knowing that they are sharing the computer.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable Screen Sharing:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sharing

Uncheck Screen Sharing

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to turn off Screen Sharing:

$ sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.screensharing

"FAILED","""2.4.5 Ensure Remote Login Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

Remote Login allows an interactive terminal connection to a computer.

Rationale:

Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers.

macOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource-intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.




Impact:

The SSH server built-in to macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications including email, web browser and productivity tools should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management tool-sets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate admin service accounts.

For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:

Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.

Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.

Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable Remote Login:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sharing

Uncheck Remote Login

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable Remote Login:

$ sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off

Do you really want to turn remote login off? If you do, you will lose this connection and can only turn it back on locally at the server (yes/no)?

Entering yes will disable remote login.

"FAILED","""2.4.6 Ensure DVD or CD Sharing Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

DVD or CD Sharing allows users to remotely access the system's optical drive. While Apple does not ship Macs with built-in optical drives any longer, external optical drives are still recognized when they are connected. In testing the sharing of an external optical drive persists when a drive is reconnected.

Rationale:

Disabling DVD or CD Sharing minimizes the risk of an attacker using the optical drive as a vector for attack and exposure of sensitive data.

Impact:

Many Apple devices are now sold without optical drives and drive sharing may be needed for legacy optical media. The media should be explicitly re-shared as needed rather than using a persistent share. Optical drives should not be used for long term storage. To store necessary data from an optical drive it should be copied to another form of external storage. Optionally, an image can be made of the optical drive so that it is stored in it's original form on another form of external storage

Solution:
Perform the following to disable DVD or CD Sharing:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Uncheck DVD or CD sharing

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable DVD or CD Sharing:

$ sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.ODSAgent

"FAILED","""2.4.8 Ensure File Sharing Is Disabled - SMB"" : [FAILED]

Server Message Block (SMB), Common Internet File System (CIFS) When Windows (or possibly Linux) computers need to access file shared on a Mac, SMB/CIFS file sharing is commonly used. Apple warns that SMB sharing stores passwords is a less secure fashion than AFP sharing and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account. When sharing with SMB, each user that will access the Mac must have SMB enabled.

Rationale:

By disabling File Sharing, the remote attack surface and risk of unauthorized access to files stored on the system is reduced.

Impact:

File Sharing can be used to share documents with other users but hardened servers should be used rather than user endpoints. Turning on File Sharing increases the visibility and attack surface of a system unnecessarily.

Solution:
Perform the following to disable File Sharing:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Sharing

Uncheck File Sharing

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable SMB file sharing:

$ sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.smbd

"FAILED","""2.4.11 Ensure AirDrop Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

AirDrop is Apple's built-in on demand ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other.

In many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.

While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards.

Rationale:

AirDrop can allow malicious files to be downloaded from unknown sources. Contacts Only limits may expose personal information to devices in the same area.

Impact:

Disabling AirDrop can limit the ability to move files quickly over the network without using file shares.

Rationale:

Encrypting sensitive data minimizes the likelihood of unauthorized users gaining access to it.

Impact:

Mounting a FileVaulted volume from an alternate boot source will require a valid password to decrypt it.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable FileVault:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Security & Privacy

Select FileVault

Additional Information:

FileVault may not be desirable on a virtual OS. As long as the hypervisor and file storage are encrypted the virtual OS does not need to be. Rather than checking if the OS is virtual and passing the control regardless of the encryption of the host system the normal check will be run. Security officials can evaluate the comprehensive controls outside of the OS being tested.

"FAILED","""2.5.1.2 Ensure all user storage APFS volumes are encrypted"" : [FAILED]

Apple developed a new file system that was first made available in 10.12 and then became the default in 10.13. The file system is optimized for Flash and Solid State storage and encryption. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System macOS computers generally have several volumes created as part of APFS formatting including Preboot, Recovery and Virtual Memory (VM) as well as traditional user disks.

All APFS volumes that do not have specific roles that do not require encryption should be encrypted. 'Role' disks include Preboot, Recovery and VM. User disks are labelled with '(No specific role)' by default.

Rationale:

In order to protect user data from loss or tampering volumes carrying data should be encrypted.

Impact:

While FileVault protects the boot volume data may be copied to other attached storage and reduce the protection afforded by FileVault. Ensure all user volumes are encrypted to protect data.

Solution:

"FAILED","""2.5.1.3 Ensure all user storage CoreStorage volumes are encrypted"" : [FAILED]

Apple introduced CoreStorage with 10.7. It is used as the default for formatting on macOS volumes prior to 10.13.

All HFS and CoreStorage Volumes should be encrypted

Rationale:

In order to protect user data from loss or tampering, volumes carrying data should be encrypted

Impact:

While FileVault protects the boot volume data may be copied to other attached storage and reduce the protection afforded by FileVault. Ensure all user volumes are encrypted to protect data.

Solution:
Use Disk Utility to erase a disk and format as macOS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)

"FAILED","""2.5.2.2 Ensure Firewall Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

A firewall is a piece of software that blocks unwanted incoming connections to a system. Apple has posted general documentation about the application firewall.

http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642

Rationale:

A firewall minimizes the threat of unauthorized users from gaining access to your system while connected to a network or the Internet.

Impact:

The firewall may block legitimate traffic. Applications that are unsigned will require special handling.

Solution:
Perform the following to turn the firewall on:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

"FAILED","""2.5.2.3 Ensure Firewall Stealth Mode Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

While in Stealth mode the computer will not respond to unsolicited probes, dropping that traffic.

http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642

Rationale:

Stealth mode on the firewall minimizes the threat of system discovery tools while connected to a network or the Internet.

Impact:

Traditional network discovery tools like ping will not succeed. Other network tools that measure activity and approved applications will work as expected.

This control aligns with the primary macOS use case of a laptop that is often connected to untrusted networks where host segregation may be non-existent. In that use case hiding from the other inmates is likely more than desirable. In use cases where use is only on trusted LANs with static IP addresses stealth mode may not be desirable.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable stealth mode:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Security & Privacy

Select Firewall Options

Turn on Enable stealth mode

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to enable stealth mode:

$ sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on

"FAILED","""2.5.6 Ensure Limit Ad Tracking Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

Apple provides a framework that allows advertisers to target Apple users and end-users with advertisements. While many people prefer that when they see advertising it is relevant to them and their interests, the detailed information that is data mining collected, correlated, and available to advertisers in repositories is often disconcerting. This information is valuable to both advertisers and attackers and has been used with other metadata to reveal users' identities.

Organizations should manage advertising settings on computers rather than allow users to configure the settings.

Apple Information

Ad tracking should be limited on 10.15 and prior.

Rationale:

Organizations should manage user privacy settings on managed devices to align with organizational policies and user data protection requirements.

Impact:

Uses will see generic advertising rather than targeted advertising. Apple warns that this will reduce the number of relevant ads.

Solution:
Perform the following to set limited ad tracking:

Open System Preferences

Select Security & Privacy

Select Privacy

Select Apple Advertising

Uncheck Personalized Ads

Terminal Method:
For each needed user, run the following command to enable limited ad tracking:

$ sudo -u <username> defaults -currentHost write /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Adlib.plist allowApplePersonalizedAdvertising -bool false

example:

$ sudo -u seconduser defaults -currentHost write /Users/seconduser/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Adlib.plist forceLimitAdTracking -bool true

"FAILED","""2.7.2 Ensure Time Machine Volumes Are Encrypted"" : [FAILED]

One of the most important security tools for data protection on macOS is FileVault. With encryption in place it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a Time Machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use.

While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes.

Rationale:

Backup volumes need to be encrypted.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable encryption on the Time Machine drive:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Time Machine

Select Backup Disk...

Select the existing Time Machine backup drive from the Available Drive list

Set Encrypt backups

Select Use Disk

Note: You can set encryption through Disk Utility or diskutil in terminal.

"FAILED","""2.8 Ensure Wake for Network Access Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

This feature allows the computer to take action when the user is not present and the computer is in energy saving mode. These tools require FileVault to remain unlocked and fully rejoin known networks. This macOS feature is meant to allow the computer to resume activity as needed regardless of physical security controls.

This feature allows other users to be able to access your computer's shared resources, such as shared printers or iTunes playlists, even when your computer is in sleep mode. In a closed network when only authorized devices could wake a computer it could be valuable to wake computers in order to do management push activity. Where mobile workstations and agents exist the device will more likely check in to receive updates when already awake. Mobile devices should not be listening for signals on any unmanaged network or where untrusted devices exist that could send wake signals.

Rationale:

Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access.

Impact:

Management programs like Apple Remote Desktop Administrator use wake-on-LAN to connect with computers. If turned off, such management programs will not be able to wake a computer over the LAN. If the wake-on-LAN feature is needed, do not turn off this feature.

The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the Benchmark. Forcing the computer to stay on and use energy in case a management push is needed is contrary to most current management processes. Only keep computers unslept if after hours pushes are required on closed LANs.

Solution:
Perform the following disable Wake for network access or Power Nap:
Graphical Method:

Open System Preferences

Select Energy Saver

"FAILED","""3.3 Ensure install.log Is Retained for 365 or More Days and No Maximum Size - ttl"" : [FAILED]

macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file /var/log/install.log and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization.

The default value has an 'all_max' file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention and a less precise rotation argument.

The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year.

While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired.

Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information.

man asl.conf

The maximum file size limitation string should be removed 'all_max='

An organization appropriate retention should be added 'ttl='

The rotation should be set with timestamps 'rotate=utc' or 'rotate=local'

Rationale:

Archiving and retaining install.log for at least a year is beneficial in the event of an incident as it will allow the user to view the various changes to the system along with the date and time they occurred.




Impact:

Without log files system maintenance and security forensics cannot be properly performed.

Solution:
Perform the following to ensure that install logs are retained for at least 365 days:
Edit the /etc/asl/com.apple.install file and add or modify the ttl value to 365 or greater on the file line. Also, remove the all_max= setting and value from the file line.

"FAILED","""3.4 Ensure Security Auditing Retention Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

The macOS audit capability contains important information to investigate security or operational issues. This resource is only completely useful if it is retained long enough to allow technical staff to find the root cause of anomalies in the records.

Retention can be set to respect both size and longevity. To retain as much as possible under a certain size the recommendation is to use the following:

expire-after:60d OR 1G

More info in the man page man audit_control

Rationale:

The audit records need to be retained long enough to be reviewed as necessary.

Impact:

The recommendation is that at least 60 days or 1 gigabyte of audit records are retained. Systems that have very little remaining disk space may have issues retaining sufficient data.

Solution:
Perform the following to set the audit retention length:
Edit the /etc/security/audit_control file so that expire-after: is at least 60d OR 1G

"FAILED","""3.5 Ensure Access to Audit Records Is Controlled - /var/audit"" : [FAILED]

The audit system on macOS writes important operational and security information that can be both useful for an attacker and a place for an attacker to attempt to obfuscate unwanted changes that were recorded. As part of defense-in-depth the /etc/security/audit_control configuration and the files in /var/audit should be owned only by root with group wheel with read-only rights and no other access allowed. macOS ACLs should not be used for these files.

Rationale:

Audit records should never be changed except by the system daemon posting events. Records may be viewed or extracts manipulated, but the authoritative files should be protected from unauthorized changes.

Impact:

This control is only checking the default configuration to ensure that unwanted access to audit records is not available.

Solution:
Run the following to commands to set the audit records to the root user and wheel group:

$ sudo chown -R root:wheel /etc/security/audit_control

$ sudo chmod -R -o-rw /etc/security/audit_control

$ sudo chown -R root:wheel /var/audit/

$ sudo chmod -R -o-rw /var/audit/

Note: It is recommended to do a thorough verification process on why the audit logs have been changed before following the remediation steps. If the system has different access controls on the audit logs, and the changes cannot be traced, a new install may be prudent. Check for signs of file tampering as well as unapproved OS changes.

"FAILED","""4.4 Ensure HTTP Server Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

macOS used to have a graphical front-end to the embedded Apache web server in the Operating System. Personal web sharing could be enabled to allow someone on another computer to download files or information from the user's computer. Personal web sharing from a user endpoint has long been considered questionable, and Apple has removed that capability from the GUI. Apache however is still part of the Operating System and can be easily turned on to share files and provide remote connectivity to an end-user computer. Web sharing should only be done through hardened web servers and appropriate cloud services.

Rationale:

Web serving should not be done from a user desktop. Dedicated webservers or appropriate cloud storage should be used. Open ports make it easier to exploit the computer.

Impact:

The web server is both a point of attack for the system and a means for unauthorized file transfers.

"FAILED","""5.1.1 Ensure Home Folders Are Secure"" : [FAILED]

By default, macOS allows all valid users into the top level of every other user's home folder and restricts access to the Apple default folders within. Another user on the same system can see you have a 'Documents' folder but cannot see inside it. This configuration does work for personal file sharing but can expose user files to standard accounts on the system.

The best parallel for Enterprise environments is that everyone who has a Dropbox account can see everything that is at the top level but can't see your pictures. Similarly with macOS, users can see into every new Directory that is created because of the default permissions.

Home folders should be restricted to access only by the user. Sharing should be used on dedicated servers or cloud instances that are managing access controls. Some environments may encounter problems if execute rights are removed as well as read and write. Either no access or execute only for group or others is acceptable.

Rationale:

Allowing all users to view the top level of all networked users' home folder may not be desirable since it may lead to the revelation of sensitive information.

Impact:

If implemented, users will not be able to use the 'Public' folders in other users' home folders. 'Public' folders with appropriate permissions would need to be set up in the /Shared folder.

Solution:
For each user, run the following command to secure all home folders:

$ sudo /bin/chmod -R og-rwx /Users/<username>

Alternately, run the following command if there needs to be executable access for a home folder:

$ sudo /bin/chmod -R og-rw /Users/<username>

example:

$ sudo /bin/chmod -R og-rw /Users/thirduser/

$ sudo /bin/chmod -R og-rwx /Users/fourthuser/

"FAILED","""5.1.4 Ensure Library Validation Is Enabled"" : [FAILED]

Library Validation is a security feature introduced in macOS 10.10 Yosemite. Library Validation protects processes from loading arbitrary libraries. This stops root from loading arbitrary libraries into any process (depending on SIP status),and keeps root from becoming more powerful. Security is strengthened, because some user processes can no longer be fooled to run additional code without root's explicit request, which may grant access to daemons that depend on Library Validation for secure validation of code identity.

Rationale:

Running without Library Validation on a production system runs the risk of the modification of system binaries or code injection of system processes that would otherwise be protected by Library Validation.

Impact:

System binaries and processes could load arbitrary libraries.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable library validation:
Terminal Method:
Run the following command to set library validation:

$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.libraryvalidation.plist DisableLibraryValidation -bool false

Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.security.libraryvalidation

"FAILED","""5.2.1 Ensure Password Account Lockout Threshold Is Configured"" : [FAILED]

The account lockout threshold specifies the amount of times a user can enter an incorrect password before a lockout will occur.

Ensure that a lockout threshold is part of the password policy on the computer.

Rationale:

The account lockout feature mitigates brute-force password attacks on the system.

Impact:

The number of incorrect log on attempts should be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user log on.

The locked account will auto-unlock after a few minutes when bad password attempts stop. The computer will accept the still-valid password if remembered or recovered.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable Password Account Thresholds to less than or equal to 5:
Terminal Method:
Run the following command to set the maximum number of failed login attempts to less than or equal to 5:

$ sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'maxFailedLoginAttempts=<value<=5>'

"FAILED","""5.2.2 Ensure Password Minimum Length Is Configured"" : [FAILED]

A minimum password length is the fewest number of characters a password can contain to meet a system's requirements.

Ensure that a minimum of a 15-character password is part of the password policy on the computer.

Where the confidentiality of encrypted information in FileVault is more of a concern requiring a longer password or passphrase may be sufficient rather than imposing additional complexity requirements that may be self-defeating.

Rationale:

Information systems that are not protected with strong password schemes including passwords of minimum length provide a greater opportunity for attackers to crack the password and gain access to the system.

Impact:

Short passwords can be easily attacked.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable passwords of a minimum length of 15:
Terminal Method:
Run the following command to set the password length to greater than or equal to 15:

$ sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'minChars=<value>=15>'

example:

$ sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'minChars=15'

"FAILED","""5.2.7 Ensure Password Age Is Configured"" : [FAILED]

Over time passwords can be captured by third-parties through mistakes, phishing attacks, third party breaches or merely brute force attacks. To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed) users should reset passwords periodically. This control uses 365 days as the acceptable value. Some organizations may be more or less restrictive. This control mainly exists to mitigate against password reuse of the macOS account password in other realms that may be more prone to compromise. Attackers take advantage of exposed information to attack other accounts.

Rationale:

Passwords should be changed periodically to reduce exposure.

Impact:

Required password changes will lead to some locked computers requiring admin assistance.

"FAILED","""5.2.8 Ensure Password History Is Configured"" : [FAILED]

Over time passwords can be captured by third-parties through mistakes, phishing attacks, third party breaches or merely brute force attacks. To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed) users must reset passwords periodically. This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous password hashes. Ensure that password history checks are part of the password policy on the computer. This control checks whether a new password is different than the previous 15. The latest NIST guidance based on exploit research referenced in this section details how one of the greatest risks is password exposure rather than password cracking. Passwords should be changed to a new unique value whenever a password might have been exposed to anyone other than the account holder. Attackers have maintained persistent control based on predictable password change patterns and substantially different patterns should be used in case of a leak.

Rationale:

Old passwords should not be reused.

Impact:

Required password changes will lead to some locked computers requiring admin assistance.

Solution:
Perform the following to enable new passwords to be different than at least the last 15 passwords:

"FAILED","""5.3 Ensure the Sudo Timeout Period Is Set to Zero"" : [FAILED]

The sudo command allows the user to run programs as the root user. Working as the root user allows the user an extremely high level of configurability within the system. This control along with the control to use a separate timestamp for each tty limits the window where an unauthorized user, process or attacker could utilize legitimate credentials that are valid for longer than required.

Rationale:

The sudo command stays logged in as the root user for five minutes before timing out and re-requesting a password. This five-minute window should be eliminated since it leaves the system extremely vulnerable. This is especially true if an exploit were to gain access to the system, since they would be able to make changes as a root user.

Impact:

This control has a serious impact where users often have to use sudo. It is even more of an impact where users have to use sudo multiple times in quick succession as part of normal work processes. Organizations with that common use case will likely find this control too onerous and are better to accept the risk of not requiring a 0 grace period.

In some ways the use of sudo -s, which is undesirable, is better than a long grace period since that use does change the hash to show that it is a root shell rather than a normal shell where sudo commands will be implemented without a password.

Solution:
Run the following command to edit the sudo settings:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/visudo

Add the line Defaults timestamp_timeout=0 in the Override built-in defaults section.

"FAILED","""5.6 Ensure the 'root' Account Is Disabled"" : [FAILED]

The root account is a superuser account that has access privileges to perform any actions and read/write to any file on the computer. With some Linux distros the system administrator may commonly use the root account to perform administrative functions.

Rationale:

Enabling and using the root account puts the system at risk since any successful exploit or mistake while the root account is in use could have unlimited access privileges within the system. Using the sudo command allows users to perform functions as a root user while limiting and password protecting the access privileges. By default the root account is not enabled on a macOS computer. An administrator can escalate privileges using the sudo command (use -s or -i to get a root shell).

Impact:

Some legacy POSIX software might expect an available root account.

Solution:
Perform the following to ensure that the root user is disabled:
Graphical Method:

Open /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Directory Utility

Click the lock icon to unlock the service

Click Edit

Click Disable Root User

Terminal Method:

Safari evaluates file safety by using a list of filetypes maintained by Apple. The list of files include text, image, video and archive formats that would be run in the context of the OS rather than the browser.

Rationale:

Hackers have taken advantage of this setting via drive-by attacks. These attacks occur when a user visits a legitimate website that has been corrupted. The user unknowingly downloads a malicious file either by closing an infected pop-up or hovering over a malicious banner. An attacker can create a malicious file that will fall within Safari's safe file list that will download and execute without user input.

Impact:

Apple considers many files that the operating system itself auto-executes as 'safe files.' Many of these files could be malicious and could execute locally without the user even knowing that a file of a specific type had been downloaded.

Solution:
Perform the following to set safe files to not open after downloading in Safari:
Graphical Method:

Open Safari

Select Safari from the menu bar

Select Preferences

Select General

Uncheck Open 'safe' files after downloading

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to disable safe files from not opening in Safari:

$ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write /Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads -bool false

example:

$ sudo -u firstuser /usr/bin/defaults write /Users/firstuser/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads -bool false

Note: To run the Terminal commands, Terminal must be granted Full Disk Access in the Security & Privacy pane in System Preferences.
Profile Method:

Create or edit a configuration profile with the PayLoadType of com.apple.Safari

Add the key Forced

Set the key to the following:

<array>
<dict>
<key>mcx_preference_settings</key>
<dict>
<key>AutoOpenSafeDownloads</key>
<false/>
</dict>
</dict>

"None","This plugin reports the SSH commands that failed with a response
indicating that privilege escalation is required to run them. Either
privilege escalation credentials were not provided, or the command
failed to run with the provided privilege escalation credentials. 

NOTE: Due to limitations inherent to the majority of SSH servers, 
this plugin may falsely report failures for commands containing 
error output expected by sudo, such as 'incorrect password', 
'not in the sudoers file', or 'not allowed to execute'."
